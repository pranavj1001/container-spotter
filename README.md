# Container Spotter


### Aim
The aim of the project is to find a way to fit the maximum amount of boxes possible in a single bin or container visually.

### How to get started?

### Technologies used

1. Docker
2. React
3. AWS
4. Travis CI

### What's still in development

1. Save Item and Bin data
2. User Management
3. Home Page

Apart from the above mentioned things, I'll also be working on further refining the core algorithm.

### Usage

### Working Example

The application was hosted on AWS. However, that costs money. So I hosted a *lite* version of the project on my [github.io](https://pranavj1001.github.io)

Also, if you want to run the project on your machine then please follow the steps mentioned here.

Some screenshots of the application are attached below
